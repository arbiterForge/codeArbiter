#!/usr/bin/env python3
# codeArbiter — shared hook helpers (issues #24, #25).
#
# Replaces the bash+jq hook layer with a cross-platform, fail-LOUD Python
# implementation. The bash hooks began with `which jq > /dev/null || exit 0`,
# so on any machine without jq (e.g. a stock Windows install) EVERY safety gate
# silently evaporated with no signal — the plugin appeared installed but was
# inert. Python is already a plugin dependency (statusline, scaffolder), needs
# no jq, and lets a hook fail loud instead of fail open.
#
# Blocking contract: a PreToolUse hook BLOCKS the tool call by exiting 2 (its
# stderr is fed back to Claude). Exit 0 allows. The prior bash hooks used
# exit 1 — a NON-blocking error under Claude Code's hook contract — so their
# "BLOCKED" gates may not have been stopping the tool at all; this port closes
# that latent gap.
#
# Interpreter launch: hooks.json registers every hook TWICE — `python3 <script>`
# plus a fallback `python3 -c "" || python <script>`. Stock Windows often has no
# real python3 (the Microsoft Store stub exits 9009), which would make every
# gate fail OPEN; the fallback entry probes for python3 and runs `python` only
# when it is absent. A single `python3 x || python x` entry would be wrong: when
# python3 exists and the script BLOCKS (exit 2), `||` would re-run it against a
# drained stdin and the rerun's exit 0 would swallow the block. Separate hook
# entries each receive their own stdin, so the block survives.
